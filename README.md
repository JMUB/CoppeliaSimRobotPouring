# CoppeliaSimRobotPouring

Robot pouring simulation with a UR5 robot arm and a parallel jaw gripper. The simulation was implemented using the robotics simulator CoppeliaSim Version 4.8.0 (rev. 0) with
the Open Dynamics Engine (ODE). 

In the simulation, the robot pours simulated marbles, represented by particles, from a source container into a target container.

The simulator is free to use, in the form of an educational version, by students, teachers and professors alike belonging to a University. We provide the python script
running the pouring simulation in CoppeliaSim and the corresponding file describing the robot environment.
